## Interview style
- Friendly, not an interrogation

  - It can be 5-10 questions
  - Ask something specific, that will make a candidate feel like you prepared for them personally
- Prepare the tasks + prepare to share them

- Don't ask questions you don't know how to validate

- Do you like the code that you wrote?
- Do you have ideas how to improve the code you wrote?
- If you'd take this code to production, how would you change it?
- How maintainable do you think the code is?
- What will need to change if the input changes?
- Is there a way to make it more performant?
- Why did you prefer to write it in this way, over the other ways?
- What was the priority for you when you were writing the code: readability, performance, other?

### 3. Architectural discussions
- Ask candidate to come up with a system design for a certain application?
- No need to have a perfect architecture, but check:
  - effective and clear communication and explanation
  - suitable design
  - trade-offs
- Whiteboard or paper might be helpful

### 4. Q&A
- Let the candidate ask questions for interviewers
  - If they are shy, suggest them a questions (like "do you want to know how we work in PD? etc")

- Ask for feedback about the interview, listen openly
- Explain the next steps
- Show their way out

## After the interview
- Stay on the call with another interviewer to discuss
- Fill out the feedback form in Lever
  - leave free-form feedback in the end (especially when it's a "no")
- If there are disagreements regarding the interview result, recruiter will gather the hiring team to decide
- If it's hard to make a decision (esp. with seniors), additional interview can be scheduled

## Possible issues with candidates
- Nervous
  - It's important to subtract the nervousness from candidate's actual skill
  - Make them feel more informal (chit-chat)
  - Make a question more specific, guide them
  - Lead it as a conversation
  - Tell them what you expect them to respond
  - Rephrase and elaborate the question
  - Simplify the requirements of the task (don't worry about the complexity, just solve it in any way)
  - Let it go and move to something else. Come back later when the situation is more relaxed (or leave it be)
  - Help out with some answers
  - If nothing works, propose a home assignment (only as a last resort)
- Inexperienced (compared to what you expected)
  - Don't have too high expectations
  - Chill out, see what strengths they still might have, don't end the interview earlier
- Overconfident
- Candidate is cheating
  - Be open with them
  - If they've seen this exercise before, ask them to tweak it

## What could go wrong
- Bad internet
  - If it's too bad - reschedule
- Candidate is late
  - Fine to wait for 5 min, if later - notify a recruiter, reschedule
- Zoom meeting timeout
  - Give feedback to a recruiter
- Noisy environment
  - Can also offer to reschedule
- Computer not working
  - Ask what can be done to solve it / skip something / reschedule
- Candidate might have seen the tasks
  - Be honest about it
  - Alter the tasks
  - Give set of other tasks
- Unfriendliness
  - Remain polite and friendly
- No confidence
- Wrong assessment of a candidate

## What to pay attention to
- Overall style
- Naming
- How they use tools
  - Starting from downloading the task
  - How they open files
  - How they use an IDE: rename variables, navigating through code, etc.
- How they google
- How they communicate
  - How they explain what they are about to do before, during and after coding
  - How they respond, when their solutions are challenged
- How they answer questions, if they are listening at all
