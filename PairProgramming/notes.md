# PP

## Roles
Driver
Navigator

Pairing is about discussion.

## Benefits

- Fewer defects
- Knowledge transfer
- Increased productivity
- Higher quality code and fewer bugs
- Improved morale: working together, relying on each other
- Constant review:
  + more optimal core review process as you are getting reviewed while coding
  + saves time on PR review back and forth
  + allows changing solutions while coding not after the fact
  + same context for both
- Increased readability

## When

Should:
- Complex code
- Volatile sections
- Critical systems: piece of code that is critical but known to a few people, etc
- Core libraries: writing code for others to use

Shouldn't:
- Trivial tasks: not a lot of thought or effort
- Spiking code: writing non-production sample code, POCs, playing around, etc

You are already doing PP when you are: debugging together, designing solutions, doing code reviews, etc

## Research on PP

__Problems:__
- Cost efficiency
- Scheduling
- Personality clashes
- Disagreements
- Better design
- Style differences

__Effective partner:__

- Smart
- Personable
- Strong developer

__Effective PP team:__
- Good communication
- Complementary skills (diverse skills and experiences)
- Compatible personalities
- Team works effectively
- No ego

The lower the skill, the more benefit from PP.
Seniors benefit from PP only working on most complex tasks.

## Techniques

### 1. Ping pong

TDD

1. Write failing test
2. Switch places
3. Make test pass
4. Repeat

__Benefits:__
- collective code ownership
- consistent switching
- TDD
- shared decision making

__Important discussions during PP:__
- Naming and style
- Design discussions
- What to work on next

### 2. Pomodoro pairing

15/20/25 min intervals

### Switching

- Timed
- Task-based (when unit of work is finished, e.g. TDD test is written)
- Ad hoc (switching arbitrarily, e.g. when stuck, or upon request from either side)

### Partner rotation

Rotating between partners in PP teams helps new ideas spread and knowledge be shared.

### Tips

"Turn up the good"
Reflect on what worked well and focus on it, make more of it, enable it better.
Maximize value the team is getting from the things that are proven to be effective.

### Dangers

- Disengagement
- "Watch the master"
- Silence (unless partner asks for it and there is an agreement)
